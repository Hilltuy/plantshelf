# ðŸŒ¿PlantShelf  
PlantShelf is a webpage which shows image/information cards for different plants. You can [see the full version (with the card flip extension) running here](https://s-mangan.github.io/plantshelf/).  

In these 2 lessons, you will:  
* Explore and modify the structure (HTML) and style (CSS) of PlantShelf.  
* Learn to use GitHub and git to back up and version-control your code.

## Instructions
## **â¯ˆPart A** GitHub and HTML
### GitHub â”‚ Forking a repository
GitHub is a website which stores filesâ€”all their past versions. The files for the PlantShelf webpage (including this README!) are stored in a folder (or *repository*) on GitHub. Your first step is to make your own copy (or *fork*) of this folder on GitHub.

- [ ] Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com/signup) and create a free account (or login if you already have one).

- [ ] Go to [the PlantShelf repository](https://github.com/S-Mangan/plantshelf), click Fork, and accept all the defaults.

## **â¯ˆPart B**â€ƒCSS
- [ ] **TODO** variables... try changing  
- [ ] **TODO** rem  
- [ ] **TODO** flex... flex-direction: column vs row    
- [ ] **TODO** grid... try changing gap,  grid-template-columns  
- [ ] **TODO** psuedo classes and transitions

## [optional] Card flipping extension
* In  index.html, uncomment all the `<div class="back side">` sections.  
* Also in index.html, link the additional `flip_extension.css` stylesheet.  
* What happens now when you hover over a card?  
* Investigate the TODOs in `flip_extension.css` and try to make the cards flip.  

## [optional] Further information and useful tools
#### Visual Studio Code â”‚ Live Server extension
* Search and install the Live Server extension (View > Open View... Extensions).  
* Inside your index.html, right click and select "Open with Live Server". A new browser tab should open with your page, and will automatically reload whenever you save a change to the html or css (so you no longer have to refresh!)
